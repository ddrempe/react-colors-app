# Task description

Create a new project using create-react-app.

Push the initial commit without your changes.

You can run it with npm start.

Button specification:

- clicking the button should get a random color from GET http://www.colr.org/json/color/random
- use the random color for the text of the button
- add the previous color to the list described below, but only if not already listed

List specification:

- Lists previous (unique) text colors.
- 1 color per line
- Printed in hex and using that color
- Currently applied color should be bolded (highlighted)
- Add functionality to move colors up and down (arrows or drag-n-drop)
- **Bonus**: At the end of the list, add an input field to manually enter the next color (on enter key)
  - If input text is not a valid hex color, show an error message.
  - The new color is used to color the text in the button above
  - And if new, add it to the list

Text Input specifications:

- Changing the text on the input should change the text in the button above.

Notes:

- No requirements regarding implementation.

- Feel free to add dependencies.
- You can use the Fetch API.

Push your changes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
